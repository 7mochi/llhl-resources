Map Description         : I just knocked this little arena together in an evening for no apparent
			  reason. I didn't have any idea of what I was building or how it would 
			  turn out, but I'm quite happy with the result. Its best suited to arena
			  mode of the Adrenaline Gamer mod, but it also works fine in deathmatch.

Misc Author Info        : This is my third map release. I am currently 17 [at 06/03/02] and live 
			  in Scotland in a little town called North Berwick where i skateboard,
			  map and piss about on computers. Sometime i hope to gain a career in a
			  level design...nothing wrong with optimism :)
