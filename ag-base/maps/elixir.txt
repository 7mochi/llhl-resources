Map Description         : HLDM map set in an abandoned factory style setting (i'm highly original!).
			  Best suited for a player load of 2-8, it could handle more if you 
			  like a hectic game. All the weapons except the hornetgun are in since the 
			  hornetgun sucks! Incase you don't guess, you can climb the pipes and grass
			  in some areas, just like normal ladders. If for some reason you instantly
			  fall in love with the map and need more to do with it, then get my graphic
			  for your desktop wallpaper [it is on the files page below...].

			PS. I'd like apologise to people on low spec machines about the r_speeds, but
			    I guess i decided to put detail ahead of speed this time around :( All i 
			    can suggest is to stay on the ground floor or play another map :/

Misc Author Info        : This is my second map release. I am currently 17 [at 29/8/01] and live 
			  in Scotland in a little town called North Berwick where i skateboard,
			  map and piss about on computers. Sometime i hope to gain a career in a
			  level design...nothing wrong with optimism :)
