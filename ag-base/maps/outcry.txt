Description             : This map should hopefully prove to be a popular Internet server map as well as an ideal LAN sized map.
			  It should also help promote team-play strategies, whilst not looking like the typical team-play level.
			  The weapons are placed in such places that they can guarded - making them quite hard to get.
			  
			  People often moan about my levels lacking a coherent theme. Well this level has a theme .. mine :) Its a
			  Scary-one map - can't you tell? That basically means that it should look and play well. Learning the level
			  shouldn't be too tough either ... logical connections and vertical situations should also be abundant. 
			  
			  I've worked hard with detail ... as well as with the r_speeds. Enraged was looked good .. but the balance tipped
			  in favour of the beauty .. allowing r_speeds to slip in places (although it still works well). Outcry peaks at
			  just about 600 - whilst barely comprimising with the beauty. I'm satisfied with the result. 
			  My belief is that people will happily play a bare looking level if it is great .. but they will definately prefer 
			  to play a great looking level that runs equally well. Somehow its more pleasant to be there (just my opinion of course). 

Other Levels by me ....  : Manhunt (manhunt.bsp) and Enraged (enraged2.bsp) available from Radium or my homepage.
