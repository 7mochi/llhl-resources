Bottomline: The design should not be that different from regular
	    HL-maps and also add some fresh wind into the details.
	    Some texture works and design tweaks, also using the
	    latest known technics and necsessary functionality, 
	    the map should "feel" like a old scool Half-Life map. 
	    So it began... 


	    The map was planned, as one more quality deathmatch map
	    for the Half-Life community. Fun for ffa-games and also
            a good map for leaques and cups. But i decided to 
	    turn around the basic idea of the map, because the map
	    had the chance to be a great leaque map wit hsome changes.
	    After weeks of redesigns and betatests, it came to an
	    end.
	    Isotonic is now somewhat "none-ffa-styled".
	    The maps gameplay and layout, should satisfy any 
	    hardcore gamer nowadays and espacially modern HL-Clans.
	    Isotonic is designed, to work in a lineup for cups leaques
	    with or without the AGMOD.
