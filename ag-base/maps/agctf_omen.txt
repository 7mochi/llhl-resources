.::  Map Description  ::.

Originally created for Op4CTF, this map has received a colored facelift for use in AGCTF. Op4ctf_omen was created as a 4-day distractionary map during a streak of 'mappers block' while working on ns_eclipse. I decided to release it upon completion, and when BulliT approached me about converting op4ctf_wormhole and op4ctf_gauntlet to AGCTF, I offered to convert this one as well.
