Map Description         : This is a modified version of my HLDM map "Forsaken". It has been converted
			  to work with the Adrenaline Gamer mod's CTF game mode.

			  The original map was quite small, so to make it suitable for 7v7 clan games
			  I mirrored it and built a new neutral area between the two large bases. I
			  am very happy with how the layout turned out, and to me it seems like the
			  map makes a better CTF level than it did deathmatch!

			  This is a beta version of the map so feel free to give me comments on how I
			  can improve it for the final version.

Misc Author Info        : This is my ninth map release. I am an 18 year old currently studying
			  BSc Computer Games Technology at the University of Abertay in Dundee,
			  Scotland. Fingers crossed after getting this degree I will become a
			  fully fledged Level Designer working in the industry :) Outside of level
			  design I am a skateboarder, rollerblader, ice skater and snowboarder.
			  I listen to ska/punk music and play a helluva lot of computer games :)
