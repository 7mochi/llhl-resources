Map Description         : This is a small, indoors industrial/urban level that i knocked together in a
			  few days just so that I would have something to enter into the Gametribe DM
			  mapping competition. I originally planned to use my project Forsaken, but it
			  was too mammoth an undertaking to get done in time for the deadline, so I
			  started this new level instead. I drew a lot of inspiration from some UT maps
			  which will be quite obvious to people who know that game, and also from other
			  HL maps such as "Lambda Bunker", and Andrew Weldon's "Repair Bay 4".

			  Strangely, this is a map by me with....acceptable r_speeds! What ever is the
			  world coming to :) Well truth be told, this is my only indoors level, and so
			  the lack of rocks has meant I have been able to keep them low! They peak at
			  850, which is higher than I had aimed for, but its only in a small area and
			  there is little I could do with the current layout to reduce them.

			  The underground section of the map holds some powerful weapons and ammo, but
			  the ammo and items are housed in the upper regions. I intended for this to
			  add a tactical element to small team games and *fingers crossed* [i had no			  	  time to test it out] I've pulled it off.

Misc Author Info        : This is my fifth map release. I am currently 17 [at 30/04/02] and live 
			  in Scotland in a little town called North Berwick where i skateboard,
			  map and piss about on computers. Sometime i hope to gain a career in a
			  level design...nothing wrong with optimism :)
