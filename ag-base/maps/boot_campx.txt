------Map Desciption-------------------------------------------------
A refreshing view of the greatest map in existance, namely boot_camp.
This has been designed with elite-style gameplay - tau jumping, etc.
I kept the same layout, but injected my own style into the map.  I have
added a new building near the bridge that houses another long jump.
