Description             : I knocked this map up in the hours following the release of Scary_1. Normally after I release
			  a level I spend a while readjusting myself .. trying hard to think along different lines. This
			  time I didn't take the time to think .. I just built. I had no plans or ideas, and no hopes for 
			  this level. I was just "getting stuff out of my system". Anyway the end result is quite pleasant,
			  and I'm as surprised as the next guy :) It took the best part of three days to stick together, and it
			  demonstrates what I'm capable of getting out of the motor. It has been a struggle to hold on the reins of the
			  r_speeds though, and I settled on ~600. They go over in a couple of places, but very rarely and 
			  probably never higher than ~650. I've also had to be very careful with the epolys count too. Seeing
			  as the map is basically an arena - most of the action will take place there, which will result in a lot of
			  corpses in view. I've tucked a lot of ammo out of sight in order to keep things moving well, even after a few frags.
			
			  I've not looked in this, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a tweakable variable
			  somewhere which limits the number of corpses visable on the client machine. If it exists ... I advise
			  lowering this value, as well as lowering the number of drawn decals at any one time.

			  I consider this kind of map a risk, but one worth taking. It is harder to make highly acclaimed small maps than larger
			  successful ones. Larger maps can be filled with all manner of detail, where as smaller maps need the speed and look a lot barer.
			  I hope that the map get appreciated for what it is trying to achieve .. and that is to create a decent arena for the
			  small lan duel tourneys. 1 on 1 home or office matches jump to mind ... 

			  The map rotates around a central area .. and doesn't really lead anwhere else :) There is one rocket launcher 
			  placed out in the watery "cul de sac" cellar area, which is fairly risky to get. Alert opponents will always
			  know your location because of the tell-tale splashing sounds. There is also a restocking area with a few
			  goodies placed out. Once again its a risk to hang around in this place because listening to the sounds reveals a lot. 

			  I'll repeat .. it is aimed at 1 on 1. It really is 1 on 1 stuff. It is a very small level. Got it! If you choose to play
			  it with an 8 player limit, I'm not going to be held responsible for the epoly count after 30 seconds :) 

			* I am contemplating expanding this level slightly to suit 4 or 5 players, by adding a water section uder the map. I have a vision of
			* how the level would play with this extra section, and I'm quite keen to implement it. The main reason the water section is
			* absent from Scary_2 "Junior" is because I wanted to keep the level suitable for 1 on 1 play. If I do edit the map and make the planned
			* changes I'll be retexturing the level throughout and calling it Scary_2 "Senior" :) It depends a lot opon the response I get as to "junior"
			* as to whether or not I go through with it. I advise small lan players, fond of Scary_1, to mail me a word or two ...
