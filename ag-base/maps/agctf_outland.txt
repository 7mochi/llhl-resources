Map Description         : A fairly large CTF map for the AG modification. The map is not QUITE
			  symmetrical, but there are no differences to give either team a tactical
			  advantage. Watch out for the water and lava as both will hurt you. I know
			  water doesn't *normally* hurt people, but I felt it would be unfair to
			  have the water harmless. Since its around lava i suppose it could be that
			  acid water stuff that burns things :)

Misc Author Info        : This is my seventh map release. I am currently 18 [at 07/07/02] and live 
			  in Scotland in a little town called North Berwick where i skateboard,
			  map and piss about on computers. Sometime i hope to gain a career in a
			  level design...nothing wrong with optimism :)
