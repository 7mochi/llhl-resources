Description             : This map has been in the making, in theory at least, for about half a year -  in fact ever since I agreed to 
			  make a map for the clan [H.o.H] back in the early Autumn of 1999. For many reasons the original Havoc never
			  became more than than a couple of corridors, and the .rmf file of that map just ended up gathering dust on 
			  my hard drive.I started work on this Havoc about a month ago. I have worked fairly hard on it the past couple
			  of weeks, and I can safely say that the map would never have been in shape it is now if it wasn't for the assistance
			  and ideas of the [H.o.H] boys themselves. They have flooded me with criticism (constructive) - guiding me forwards
			  so that the map would be the very best it could be.

			  Havoc can be described as a multi-level Outcry follow-up. It has many of Outcry's traits, whilst being different
			  enough to stand on its own 2 feet. It borrows some of the architectural feel from its predecessor, but this was
			  completely intentional, considering that Outcry is considered by many to be my finest map to date.

			  I figure that the map is good for 4-12 players. Of course I may be wrong. It seems large at first, but connections
			  are abundant, and this allows fewer players to enjoy the map too. 

			  Main Features would be:

			  A laser platform which gives access to the Long Jump module.
			  A double action fan which bars access to the RPG and the Hornetgun .. nice :)
			  A watery trap awaiting any Egon loving sucker.

			  Extra special thanks to these [H.o.H] guys for major help and guidance, I hope you actually like the map after all this :)
