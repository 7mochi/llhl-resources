Map Description         : This is a modified version of my HLDM map "Echo". It has been converted
			  to work with the Adrenaline Gamer mod's CTF game mode.

			  The original map was quite small, so to make it suitable for 7v7 clan games
			  I mirrored it and built a new neutral area between the two bases. Although
			  the map was not designed with CTF in mind, I feel the layout works pretty
			  well. 

			  This is a beta version of the map so feel free to give me comments on how I
			  can improve it for the final version.

Misc Author Info        : This is my tenth map release. I am an 18 year old currently studying
			  BSc Computer Games Technology at the University of Abertay in Dundee,
			  Scotland. Fingers crossed after getting this degree I will become a
			  fully fledged Level Designer working in the industry :) Outside of level
			  design I am a skateboarder, rollerblader, ice skater and snowboarder.
			  I listen to ska/punk music and play a helluva lot of computer games :)
