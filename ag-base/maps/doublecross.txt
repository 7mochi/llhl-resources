The first map is Dario Casali's follow-up to Crossfire, called
DoubleCross.Here are his comments and the BSP.

The principal is the same as in Crossfire. There is a bunker which can
be used to call a nuclear strike against anyone outside of it every four
minutes. Once the strike has been called, a one minute warning siren
activates, giving everyone the chance to get to the bunker. There are
far more tactical points in this map than in Crossfire and it also
addresses the bug in the Crossfire where people wouldn't get killed by
the strike sometimes.
