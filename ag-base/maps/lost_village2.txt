Description		: The map is the second village-map from me
			  I designed this map for arms-priority-DM/TP.
			  The ambience is a little asia-like i think
			  and the gameplay is like in lost village 1:
			  fast! get your eyes open and watch out!
			  Two buildings are placed in the map. Both
			  have a second floor where you can hideout 
			  and find weapons. stay not to long there and
			  beware yourself of campers hehe :-)
			  also some big crates are standing around in
			  the map. watch on the top of them for
			  goodies!

Additional Credits to   : The Clanmembers of Half-Life for testing

			  testing the gameplay at LAN-games ;)

Clanfriends from me and some other people said: please make no
secret areas in this map. Others have said: make secrets....
so what?! i have made NO secret areas in lost_village 2 and believe
it okay? :)) Don´t aks me for secrets in this map...
All the fragstuff you need and love is around in the map and "easy" 
to reach to make the gameplay fast. The explosive ammo as: ARgranades and the RPG and so on, 
are placed also, but you must search for them :))
Klimb up ladders and you will see "the powers"  hehehe....
