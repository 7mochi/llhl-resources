Description		: The map is overall a structure like datacore and
				takes palce in the row of teamplay, 1on1 or
				deathmatchmaps. I am allways on the run to
				make the best possible map with the idea i have
				and this time i think, the concept and the
				gameplay of the whole map is really good and the 
				map has the stuff to make it to the top of
				Multiplayer Maps and can match the standard maps
				in some criterias now. 
				This Map is my attempt to show, how good standard
				should be and how the gameplay rules and itemplacement
				has to manage like as it is necsessary nowadays to
				satisfy the most players needs.
				This map is a product of me, with great help and
				feedback from chinx from www.adrenalinegamer.com
			  
Additional Credits to   : spacial thanks to CHiNX for improvment tips and much
				feedback on the map-betas! Thank you CHiNX 
				(chinx@clara.co.uk). [SO]Fritzman (fritzman@so-clan.de),

				And espacially simulated teamplay and 1on1 abilities.
