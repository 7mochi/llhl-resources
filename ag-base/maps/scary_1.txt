Description             : This smaller map has been designed to please the people out there looking for a smaller map to fight on. Its should house
			  2-4 players comfortably. It may feel too large for 2, especially 2 who don't know the layout intimately, but I've planned
			  the layout carefully so that it should be easy to find and stalk down prey with ease. 

			  The map signifies a turning point for me. I'm going to concentrate on this kind of level from now on. There are an
			  adequate amount of larger maps out there which are of a decent standard. The smaller maps available are sadly of a much
			  lower standard. I see a vacuum and I'll do my best to fill it. The name "Scary_1" is obviously a pun but it also denotes the
			  first map in a series of this kind of level.

			  As for appearances ... well its been made to look ugly on purpose. I've been criticised in the past for only making
			  nice looking maps so I thought I'd do one like this. The overall feel is ruddier, which isn't a bad thing. It also feels a little 
			  more realistic than my other maps to date, although I'm not sure which planet the action takes place on :)

			  Its a no gimmick map, with a minimal use of entities. It runs pretty well, and connects nicely. The rocket launcher is placed deliberately 
			  to deter players from camping by it. The gauss isn't hard to get, but it doesn't get used THAT much because it requires a long jump to get.
			  From the playtesting I've done I've noticed that it doesn't seem to be needed that much either as there is normally another equally powered
			  weapon ready to take its place in a fight. To add, from what I've managed to gather, there is no one weapon that dominates the map. The RL is
			  as powerful as ever, but the crossbow is often more effective. The MP5 is deadly too etc etc. In other words I'm hoping its balanced.
