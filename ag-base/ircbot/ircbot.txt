AG IRC Bot
--------------
What's that ? 
--------------

The AG IRC Live-Bot is a perl script, capable to broadcast on an IRC channel what's 
happening in real time on an AG server.
It's useful to follow a match.

-------------------
Pre - Installation
-------------------

If you are running a Win32 server, you need to have a perl interpreter.
On a linux server it should be installed yet.

-------------
Installation 
-------------

You need to edit the ircbot.pl file to customize the bot. Set the following variables:

$local_address  = "127.0.0.1"		    <---- enter your bothost-ip here (mostly localhost(127.0.0.1))
$irc_address 	= "irc.quakenet.eu.org";    <---- IRC server to connect 
$irc_port	= 6667;			    <---- IRC port  ( 6667 is the standard port ) 
$irc_nickname	= "AGHL";                   <---- Bot name 
$irc_channel 	= "#AGHL";                  <---- IRC channel where bot broadcast 
$hostname       = "AG Server";              <---- The hostname of your server (this one will be displayed in the IRC channel)
$advertisement  = "name/channel/whatever";  <---- Advertisement (Displayed when BOT joins IRC channel)

Additionally you can edit the Q-Auth settings.

Do NOT edit ANY other line!!!

On the GameServer set the following parameters (via rcon or write them into the server.cfg):
logaddress 127.0.0.1 28889
log on  

If you are using logmod, type this instead:
logmod add 127.0.0.1 28889 OrgSource

Note:
Use 127.0.0.1 if you are running the bot on your local host.
Otherwise, use the IP of the bothost + port: 28889.

------------
Running the bot 
------------

Windows: Run a dos/console windows. Go to the bot directory and type "perl ircbot.pl" 
Linux  : In a bash shell, go to the bot directory and type "perl ircbot.pl &"
